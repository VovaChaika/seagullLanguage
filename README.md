# seagullLanguage
Seagull language written on Python
The Seagull programming language presented here is a general purpose imperative language.
A program written in the Seagull language is fed to the input of a translator (compiler or interpreter) for transformation (translation, translation) 
to the target form (language). The result of the translation is executed in the run-time system, for which it receives input data and provides 
the result of the program.
Translation involves the phases of lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, as well as the phase of code generation. 
The phases of lexical and syntactic analysis are carried out in separate passages.
